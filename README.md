# ⛩️ Live from the Garden ⛩️
Welcome to the streams that flows through the Garden!

This repository is to document my journey through world building with the Azuki IP and learning illustration, animation, and game development along the way. 

## Learning OBS, Godot, and Streambot 

My inspiration for this project is a streamer named Tyjiro, who uses these programs on his stream to create an immersive world around his character that the chat can interact with.

With Azuki's vast IP and the world they have created, I feel like this is a unique opportunity to create something like Tyjiro has but for an entire community of users. 

The tools used in this project will be:

1. OBS - Managing the stream, overlays, and real-time visuals
2. Godot - To build the interactive 2D/3D world
3. Streambot - To detect chat interactions and trigger game/visual events
