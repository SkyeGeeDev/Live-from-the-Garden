# ⛩️ Live from the Garden ⛩️
Welcome to the streams that flows through the Garden!

This repository is to document my journey through world building with the Azuki IP and learning illustration, animation, and game development along the way. 

## Learning to draw - 1 hour daily

One of my goals for the project is the learn to draw and animate my drawing so I can make use of my Azuki Elemental and do cool things for stream.

This seciton of the ReadMe is to keep myself accountable and keep a log of how much time I have spent working on it.

I saw a video where they said that practicing drawing is very similar to FPS training, where you are aiming at the dots on the screen. Drawing is like that, except you are going from point to point to create a line, rather than target to target in an FPS training game.
## Learning OBS, Godot, and Streambot 

My inspiration for this project is a streamer named Tyjiro, who uses these programs
