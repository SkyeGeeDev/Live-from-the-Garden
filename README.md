# ⛩️ Live from the Garden ⛩️
Welcome to the streams that flows through the Garden!

This repository is to document my process through learning web development while using the Azuki world as my inspiration.

The first order of business is to create my own website. I would like to take the aesthetics of Azuki's website and make something similar, kind of going off what they have for Hilumia. 

Now this is coming from someone with little experience with web development, that best I've made was my own personal website but that was elementary level.

Job Descriptions for Azuki Roles:

Front End:
Tech Stack -  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and React

Full-stack - (NextJS/Vercel, AWS (S3, KMS, SM, Cloudfront), Express/Heroku, Prisma ORM, Postgres/PgBouncer, Cloudflare, NodeJS/Typescript, Remix)
